## Processing Data for Use in Modelling Fluid Flow

## Key Investigators
- Olga Trichtchenko (Western, Physics and Astronomy) 

# Project Description
I am completely new to Slicer, but I would like to learn about how other people use their data
so I can generate domains and meshes for use in mathematical modelling of fluid flow through these 
domains. 

## Objective
1. Learn how to use Slicer and to create STL files.
2. Find different meshing utilities to work with STL files.

## Approach and Plan

1. I will do some sample tutorials that are available online and talk to other people about what 
they commonly do.
2. I will then research the different meshing utilities available as well as their advantages and 
disadvantages, for example how memory intensive they are.
3. Using OpenFOAM, compare and contrast the meshes that are generated based on the STL files.
